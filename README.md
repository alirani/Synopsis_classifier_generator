##### What is this ?

- This is a potential creative app that uses generative models as a playground for users to generate overview of movies & tv show. It's mostly an app to learn about using and fine-tuning HuggingFace models like BERT & GPT-2.

##### What is this notebook ? Wouldn't python script be easier ?

- This is the Notebook used to make all the preparations to make a python backend for the app. Using a notebook makes it easier to experiment and also for the exploratory data analysis that'll be first made to explore the data we have to work with. Once experimentation is done, we can extract the code and put it in a lib that will be pushed into a git repository and used in the final demo & app.

##### Why this app/idea ?

- Because it enables me to learn more about how Hugging Face is used to produce models used in production. Hugging Face has become the face of NLP models and being able to use a pre-existing model and fine-tune it to fit a need is a skill that I wanted to train on.
